# TFIDF

The script 'MyTfidf.py' returns the term frequency (TF), inverse term frequence (IDF), and their products (TFIDF) of each word in a raw paragraph of texts.

TF of a word is calculated by the number of times the word appears in a sentence divided by the total number of words in that sentence.

IDF of a word is calculated by taking the natural logarithm of X, where X is the number of sentences in the paragraph of texts divided by the number of sentences that contain the word.

TFIDF of a word is calculated by taking the product of the TF and IDF of the word.
